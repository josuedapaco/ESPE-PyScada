 cutting edge.
 .
 This library performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").

Package: flatpak
Description-md5: f91acb1d2880527b2759bc5e2d99fbff
Description-en: Application deployment framework for desktop apps
 Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
 Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider system, using
 containerization techniques such as namespaces to prevent direct access
 to system resources. Resources from outside the sandbox can be accessed
 via "portal" services, which are responsible for access control; for
 example, the Documents portal displays an "Open" dialog outside the
 sandbox, then allows the application to access only the selected file.
 .
 Each application uses a specified "runtime", or set of libraries, which is
 available as /usr inside its sandbox. This can be used to run application
 bundles with multiple, potentially incompatible sets of dependencies within
 the same desktop environment.
 .
 This package contains the services and executables needed to install and
 launch sandboxed applications, and the portal services needed to provide
 limited access to resources outside the sandbox.

 archives in various formats such as tar and cpio. libarchive also supports
 reading and writing archives compressed using various compression filters such
 as gzip and bzip2. The library is inherently stream-oriented; readers serially
 iterate through the archive, writers serially add things to the archive.
 .
 Archive formats supported are:
 .
    * tar (read and write, including GNU extensions)
    * pax (read and write, including GNU and star extensions)
    * cpio (read and write, including odc and newc variants)
    * iso9660 (read and write, including Joliet and Rockridge extensions, with
      some limitations)

 system running on Node.js, such as Webpack, Rollup, or Parcel, to transpile
 your JS ahead of time.
 .
 However, there are some valid use cases for @babel/standalone:
  * It provides an easy, convenient way to prototype with Babel. Using
    @babel/standalone, you can get started using Babel with just a simple
    script tag in your HTML.
  * Sites that compile user-provided JavaScript in real-time, like JSFiddle,
    JS Bin, the REPL on the Babel site, JSitor, etc.
  * Apps that embed a JavaScript engine such as V8 directly, and want to use
    Babel for compilation
  * Apps that want to use JavaScript as a scripting language for extending the
    app itself, including all the goodies that ES2015 provides.
  * Other non-Node.js environments (ReactJS.NET, ruby-babel-transpiler,
    php-babel-transpiler, etc).

 supports the usual SSH features like port forwarding, X11 forwarding,
 SOCKS, and compression.
 .
 PSCP (PuTTY Secure Copy) transfers files securely between systems using an
 SSH connection. It works with both SSH protocol 1 and protocol 2.
 .
 PSFTP (PuTTY SFTP client) transfers files securely between systems using
 the SSH file transfer protocol, which is specific to SSH protocol 2. In
 interactive mode its interface is much like the traditional Unix FTP
 client, although it can also operate in batch mode.
 .
 PuTTYgen generates SSH public and private key pairs in any of a number of
 formats, including those usable by PuTTY, OpenSSH, and ssh.com.
 .
 psusan (pseudo-SSH for untappable, separately authenticated networks) is a
 server program that behaves like the innermost "connection" layer of an SSH
 session, without the two outer security layers of encryption and
 authentication. It can be used to add SSH-like amenities to channels where
 you were already prepared to run a bare shell session.

 .
 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,
 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.
 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

Package: tor
Description-md5: 9106e8e4b3843ebd532ba2b89615a92e
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Package: tor-geoipdb
Description-md5: d0b50c9cd91157b8c85856fd55e26d14
Description-en: GeoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.

Package: trafficserver

     needs by caching and reusing frequently-requested web pages, images, and
     web service calls.
   * Proxying: add keep-alive, filter or anonymize content requests, or add
     load balancing by adding a proxy layer.

Package: xvfb
Description-md5: 1cd5b85acd06c23d376b7b5a7f30a0b8
Description-en: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.
